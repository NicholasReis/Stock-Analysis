I figure it will be better for me to just make a notes file rather than put everything in the commit.

##I think moving forward I will separate Stock.py and DataGrabber.py
It's probably smarter to export the web data to file, then file to Stock because then I can more easily make changes later for the types of data I want.

It is also better encapsulation anyways so that they are less dependant and all the data being given to StockAnalyzer is better anyways.




I'm going to need to create a separate notepad of all the important labels and IDs so that I can expand the utility of this later.
